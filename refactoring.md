## Refactoring

Refactoring is the practice of changing code without changing what it does, usually with the intent to make it better (better organized, more readable, more fast, more accurate, better tested, etc.).

*Optional but recommended* - Watch ["All the Little Things" by Sandi Metz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bZh5LMaSmE), famous Ruby programmer.  The video is about Ruby, the principles of refactoring generalize to R and all the other languages.

## Excercises

1. What is "flog"?

2. What is the "squint test"?

3. Why is it a bad idea to have a 43-line conditional statement?

4. Why are tests important for refactoring?  Why do you not refactor until tests are passing?

5. What does "open / closed" mean? Why does that matter?

6. When is violating DRY okay?
