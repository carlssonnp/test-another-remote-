# Onboarding

Congratulations! You have joined the most technically proficient team within the company. (Highest Amount of phd's per capita) 
However as a consequence the onboarding process will be the most involved. Budget ~3 weeks to complete with all PR's merged. 
This is meant to simulate the end to end workflow of a DataScientist/DataEngineer. Once complete you will have the foundation
to "Hit The Ground Running".

*"At the advanced levels Avant will be a libertarian and give you the paintbrush to paint your own masterpiece based upon your passions, skillset, etc. 
  On the fundamentals Avant will be a dictator as having a strong base & foundation is universally beneficial."* - John Danaher [1]
