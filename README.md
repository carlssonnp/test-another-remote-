# Onboarding

Congratulations! You have joined the most technically proficient team within the company (we have the highest amount of PhD's per team member).
However, the downside of this is that we will have the most complicated onboarding process.

This repository should contain everything you need to know to get started.  **Budget about three weeks to complete all the exercises.**
This is meant to simulate the end to end workflow of a Data Scientist / Data Engineer. Once complete you will have the foundation to "Hit The Ground Running". 

While it may not add immediate business value, I encourage you to take the long-term view and think about how this three week investment will save you three months down the road as you go about your tasks as a knowledable data scientist.  If people are bugging you about doing "real work", kindly tell them that you are busy becoming superhuman and will work at 10x efficiency once the guide is complete.

*"At the advanced levels Avant will be a libertarian and give you the paintbrush to paint your own masterpiece based upon your passions, skillset, etc.
  On the fundamentals Avant will be a dictator as having a strong base and foundation is universally beneficial."* - [John Danaher @ 6 Min & 30 Sec](https://youtu.be/SpLKrhwGavU?t=390)

Complete the simulation challenges in the following order, from the top to the bottom. **This is a linear sequence of steps, not a choose your own adventure.**

Also, this guide is intended to be a dynamic, living document.  Please update it as you see fit!  Just make a PR! :)

Every simulation challenge is meant to be answered with a Pull Request (PR) to be reviewed and discussed with your Guardian. 

The human follow up discussion you will will help you gain a deeper knowledge within a domain. You don't learn to paint by reading books so lets get down to it.

### Other Ways to Learn 

* After you complete the training material, you will begin work on your first real-life task!  Yay!

* You will also have multiple **pairing sessions** (where someone else helps you with your work) and **shadowing sessions** (where you see the work of others).

* You should also participate in our morning lectures and ask questions.  (Encouraged (optional))

* You will also be invited to a Code Craftsmanship seminar to further hone your R knowledge. (Encouraged (optional))
