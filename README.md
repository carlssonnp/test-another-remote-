# Onboarding

Congratulations! You have joined the most technically proficient team within the company (we have the highest amount of PhD's per team member).
However, the downside of this is that we will have the most complicated onboarding process.

This repository should contain everything you need to know to get started.  **Budget about three weeks to complete all the exercises.**
This is meant to simulate the end to end workflow of a Data Scientist / Data Engineer. Once complete you will have the foundation to "Hit The Ground Running". 

*"At the advanced levels Avant will be a libertarian and give you the paintbrush to paint your own masterpiece based upon your passions, skillset, etc. 
  On the fundamentals Avant will be a dictator as having a strong base & foundation is universally beneficial."* - [John Danaher](https://youtu.be/SpLKrhwGavU?t=390)

## Universal Data Science Skillset

**Complete the simulation challenges in the following order. Every simulation challenge is meant to be answered with a Pull Request to be reviewed and discussed with your Guardian. 
The human follow up discussion you will will help you gain a deeper knowledge within a domain. You don't learn to paint by reading books so lets get down to it:**
