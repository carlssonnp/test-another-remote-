#
#####1. For each of parts (a) through (d), indicate whether we would generally expect the performance of a flexible statistical learning method to be better or worse than an inflexible method. Justify your answer.
#
#####(a) The sample size n is extremely large, and the number of predictors p is small.

Ans: In this case, a flexible statistical method could be expected to be better than an inflexible method because it can extract more information from the large n.


#
#####(b) The number of predictors p is extremely large, and the number of observations n is small.

Ans: In this case, we can expect a flexible statistical method performing worse than an inflexible method due to the risk of overfitting.


#
#####(c) The relationship between the predictors and response is highly non-linear.

Ans: In this case, a flexible model would better capture the non-linear relationship that an inflexible method could have difficulty to pick up. Thus, a flexible method is perferred.


#
#####(d) The variance of the error terms, i.e. Ïƒ2 = Var(), is extremely high.

Ans: High variance of the error terms means the sample has lots of noise. Thus, to avoid overfitting the noise, an inflexible method is a better choice than a flexible one.


#
#####2. Explain whether each scenario is a classification or regression problem, and indicate whether we are most interested in inference or prediction. Finally, provide *n* and *p*.

#
#####(a) We collect a set of data on the top 500 firms in the US. For each firm we record profit, number of employees, industry and the CEO salary. We are interested in understanding which factors affect CEO salary.

Ans: Regression. *n* = 500 (number of firms). *p* = 3 (profit, number of employees, and industry). *dep_var* = CEO salary


#
#####(b) We are considering launching a new product and wish to know whether it will be a success or a failure. We collect data on 20 similar products that were previously launched. For each product we have recorded whether it was a success or failure, price charged for the product, marketing budget, competition price, and ten other variables.

Ans: This problem can be classification or logistic regression. n = 20 (number of similar products). p = 13 (price charged for the product, marketing budget, competition price, and ten other variables). dep_var = success or failure.



#
#####(c) We are interesting in predicting the % change in the US dollar in relation to the weekly changes in the world stock markets. Hence we collect weekly data for all of 2012. For each week we record the % change in the dollar, the % change in the US market, the % change in the British market, and the % change in the German market.

Ans: Regression. n = 52 (weekly data in 2012). p = 3 (the % change in the US market, the % change in the British market, and the % change in the German market). dep_var = % change in the dollar



#
#####5. What are the advantages and disadvantages of a very flexible (versus a less flexible) approach for regression or classification? Under what circumstances might a more flexible approach be preferred to a less flexible approach? When might a less flexible approach be preferred?

Ans: Based on bias-variance tradeoff, a very flexible method has lower bias and higher variance. In other words, it's prediction could be very close to the truth but could be also sensitive to the change of data set (i.e., overfitting problem). 

It could be better to adopt a inflexible model when the sample variance is large and noisy. In terms of interpretaibility, flexible models could be a better choice than inflexible methods due to having more solid theoretical guarantee. 



#
#####6.  Describe the differences between a parametric and a non-parametric statistical learning approach. What are the advantages of a parametric approach to regression or classification (as opposed to a nonparametric approach)? What are its disadvantages?

Ans: The main difference betewen parametric and non-parametric methods is that the former generates parameters which gives extra information explaining the linear relationship between the dep_var and each individual independent variables (<- the advantage of parametric methods). One of the disadvantages of parametric mothods is that parametric mothods can not handle the situation when the dep_var is not linearly separable (i.e., dep_var and independent variables as low correlation coefficients). In addition, normally parametric mothods can't handle outliers or missing values in the sample.
