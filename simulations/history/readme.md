Back in our day we had to walk 15 miles to get access to credit data & build a model. 

GBM:
 * [Yoav Freund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoav_Freund) & [Robert Schapire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Schapire) are credited with the adaBoost algorithim that serves as the foundation of GBM.
 * [Jerome Friedmand](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~jhf/) is largely credited as the Driving Force behind full fledged GBM Algorithim.
   * 10 minute [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79tR7BvYE6w) where he is interviewd by [Tibshirani](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/) & [Hastie](http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/) on genesis of tree based methods. 
   
TODO: ^ FEI is this true or revisionist history?

Syberia Infrastructure:
  Originally there was no structured Framework. Large Monolothic Block of Speghetti Code with countless hacks.
  TODO: RobK fill in with his version of story and github links

**Challenge(s):**    
1) No challenges just take a brief moment to contemplate and be grateful.    
   Easier said than done.  Ok good.        
  Now you can go back to cursing about bugs.       
2) Optional Trivia. What Language was original GLMNET package programmed in?
