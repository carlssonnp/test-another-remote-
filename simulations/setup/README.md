Before you can contribute you will need to set up your machine. 
Do steps 1 through 13 in the [setup guide](https://github.com/avantcredit/avant-analytics/wiki)
Dont worry about about the subsequent Link's under "Now What" as those will be covered through the subsequent simulations.

Be able to [log into an EC2 instance](https://github.com/avantcredit/avant-analytics/wiki/Configure-your-new-EC2-instance)

Challenge(s):
  1) If you feel there are gaps in documentation in the setup process, with the help of your guardian update the documentation. Thanks! 
  2) Add yourself to the [team list](https://github.com/avantcredit/avant/blob/master/R/team.R). Use this [PR](https://github.com/avantcredit/avant/commit/b7549ca74675f934c8d28ac341a74f8945b10ee3) as a template.
