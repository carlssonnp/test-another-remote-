**Git** is the key way we have multiple people work on the same code.  Learning how to use Git is critical to being a good developer.

**Exercise 1:** [Go through the Try Git Guide](ttps://try.github.io)

**Exercise 2:** Learn [How to file a github issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/ "git issue")

**Exercise 3:** Add yourself to the [team list](https://github.com/avantcredit/avant/blob/master/R/team.R). Don't forget to "version" your contribution by updating the files `DESCRIPTION` and `CHANGELOG.md`, which means indicate your change with a version number (e.g., 0.3.15.9002) so that we can track changes.  Use this [PR](https://github.com/avantcredit/avant/pull/865/files) as a template.  You'll learn more about versioning later.

**Exercise 4:** File a github Issue within Onboarding with any thoughts on setup process.  Maybe even contribute to this repository with some fixes by making a PR.
