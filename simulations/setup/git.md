Additional avant requirements:
* Each Pull Request (PR) to merge your changes to the master branch for 'avant-analytics' repo must have a corresponding Pivotal tracker ID (and/or link).  If you skip this step, Peter's bot will yell at you.
* Don't know about [Pivotal](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/dashboard) you say.  Work with you guardian to understand how Avant organizes and uses Pivotal.

**Exercise 1:** [Go through the Try Git Guide](ttps://try.github.io)

**Exercise 2:** Learn [How to file a github issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/ "git issue").  File a quick issue on our repo with any thoughts on the set up process so far.

**Exercise 3:** Skim [Hadley Wickham's guide to git](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html) for an additional refernce.  Add yourself to the [team list](https://github.com/avantcredit/avant/blob/master/R/team.R). Don't forget to "version" your contribution by updating the files `DESCRIPTION` and `CHANGELOG.md`, which means indicate your change with a version number (e.g., 0.3.15.9002) so that we can track changes.  Use this [PR](https://github.com/avantcredit/avant/pull/865/files) as a template.  You'll learn more about versioning later.
* You do not need a Pivotal tracker ID for contributing to this repository.

**Exercise 4:** (Hint: `log` video tutorial)
   * How do you see the files changed within each commit from git log?
   * How do you see the contents of what changed within each file from the git log?
   * What does `HEAD` refer to in the context of git? (Not to be confused with the "HEAD<<<<" one observes within merge conflict)

**Exercise 5:** *(Optional)* Contribute a PR to this repo improving the onboarding guide.  Send it to your Gaurdian for review. You do not need a Pivotal tracker ID for contributing to this repository.
