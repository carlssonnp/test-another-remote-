**Git** is the key tool we use to allow multiple people to work on the same code base.  **Git** takes care of merging everyone's contributions smoothly.  Hence, learning how to use Git is critical to contributing at Avant.

## Exercises

**Exercise 1:** [Go through the Try Git Guide](https://try.github.io)

**Exercise 2:** Learn [How to file a github issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/ "git issue").  File a quick issue on our repo with any thoughts on the set up process so far.

**Exercise 3:** Watch these videos:

**Exercise 4:** Skim [Hadley Wickham's guide to git](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html) for an additional refernce.

**Exercise 5:** Use your git skills to clone this repo to your local computer. (Most people like to clone things to their `~/dev` directory.)

**Exercises 6 and 7:** Within that repository, go to the `answers` folder and create a folder with your name. Within that folder, create a `git-answers.md` file. In that file, provide answers to these questions:

   * How do you see the files changed within each commit from git log?
   * How do you see the contents of what changed within each file from the git log?
   * What does `HEAD` refer to in the context of git? (Not to be confused with the "HEAD<<<<" one observes within merge conflict)

*(No peeking at other people's answers.)*

**Exercise 8:** Create a PR with your answers to this repo. Ask your Guardian to review.

**Exercise 9:** Add yourself to the [team list](https://github.com/avantcredit/avant/blob/master/R/team.R). Don't forget to "version" your contribution by updating the files `DESCRIPTION` and `CHANGELOG.md`, which means indicate your change with a version number (e.g., 0.3.15.9002) so that we can track changes.  Use this [PR](https://github.com/avantcredit/avant/pull/865/files) as a template.  You'll learn more about versioning later.
