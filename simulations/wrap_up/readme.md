The State of the Company & Infastructure is dynamic as the state of the world changes. (Otherwise Existance wouldn't be very fun now would it?)
Therefore the state of the onboarding guide needs to grow Dynamically. In theory the Onboarding is Self Contained and does not require external intervention. 
Provide some suggestions on what it is missing and how it can be Improved. Ok those suggestions are probably good, now just 
Update the Onboarding Program with any knowledge gaps. (Can be as simple as Exercises need to be in a different order as there are knowledge contingencies)
