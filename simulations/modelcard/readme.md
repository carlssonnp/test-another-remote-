Avant uses [model cards](https://github.com/avantcredit/avant-analytics/tree/master/models/prod/default/en-US/3.0.0/README.md) to document our work, with an aim for reproducible research.

Ultimately it is an R markdown document where one can embed code with text markdown that will render the results of the executed code. 

## Read
* [R Studio R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)   
* [R Markdown cheatsheet](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)  
* [knitr showcase](http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/showcase/)
* [Getting started with Avant models and data](https://github.com/avantcredit/avant-analytics/wiki/Getting-started-with-Avant-models-and-data)

## Exercises
* Create a new Directory and you will create a similar modelcard for your model. One can Edit the README.Rmd to see template code.
 * You are going to need how to use the [make_validation_plot](https://github.com/avantcredit/make_validation_plot/blob/master/R/make_validation_plot.R) code to create a lift chart.
