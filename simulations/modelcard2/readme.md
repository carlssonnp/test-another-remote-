Let us now rigorously evaluate the Performance Improvement due to your new pre-processing methodology. 

Challenge)
  * Now that you have created a modelcard for your model train an equivalent model without your new pre-processing procedure. 
    Append a lift chart to the modelcard that contains both models on the validation set. Did your new pre-processing procedure provide any lift?
    NOTE: Verify this is an Apples to Apples comparison by training on the same data, validating on the same data, same parameterization, etc.
