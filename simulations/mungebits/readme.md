Now we are going to create a new custom mungebit!

**Exercise 1:** Read [the documentation on mungebits](https://github.com/avantcredit/avant-analytics/blob/master/lib/mungebits/README.md).

**Exercise 2:** Read ["What is a production-level classifier?"](https://github.com/robertzk/r-book/blob/master/docs/introduction/what_is_a_production_level_classifier.md) and ["Training vs. Prediction"](https://github.com/robertzk/r-book/blob/master/docs/data_preparation/training_versus_prediction.md).

**Exercise 3:** Complete the [manual cleaning exercises](https://github.com/robertzk/r-book/blob/master/docs/data_preparation/filtering_out_values.md)

**Exercise 4:** Read ["Transformations"](https://github.com/robertzk/r-book/blob/master/docs/data_preparation/transformations.md) and complete the exercises.

**Exercise 5:** Within `demo_<yourname>.R` write and insert your custom mungebit. Verify it runs successfully and one can run the file end to end.
