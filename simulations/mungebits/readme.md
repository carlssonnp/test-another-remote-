Now we are going to create a new custom mungebit! You can think of a new arbitrarily complex pre-processing procedure. 
Verify with your guardian such a function does not already exist. To write a new mungebit you might need to know what one
is and how we go about creating a new one. (Jeez so needy!) 

Read all of `Data Preperation` & `Mungebits` within avant developement [r-book](https://github.com/robertzk/r-book).
If There are any exercises within the book then submit a PR with answers.   
Within Avant-Analytics Read the [Mungebits Section](https://github.com/avantcredit/avant-analytics/tree/master/lib/mungebits)

Simulation:
  1) Within `demo_<yourname>.R` write & insert your custom mungebit. (Verify it runs successfully and one can run the file end to end)
