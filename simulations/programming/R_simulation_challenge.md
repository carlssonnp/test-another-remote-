## Exercises

1) Read the following chapters of "Advanced R" and complete all the exercises.

 * ["Data Structures"](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html)
 * ["Subsetting"](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Subsetting.html)
 * ["Functions"](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functions.html)
 * ["OO Field Guide"](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/OO-essentials.html)
 * ["Debugging"](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Exceptions-Debugging.html)
 * ["Functional Programming"](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functional-programming.html)
 * ["Functionals"](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functionals.html)

2) Hadley co-authored ["R for Data Science"](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/).  Read these two chapters:

 * ["Data Transformation"](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html)
 * ["Expressing yourself in code"](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html)

3.) **Optional for DS, Mandatory for DE** - Those who are working on R infrastructure should go back to "Advanced R" and complete the following:

* ["Function Operators"](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Function-operators.html)
* ["Non-standard evaluation"](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Computing-on-the-language.html)
* ["Expressions"](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Expressions.html)
* ["Performance"](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Performance.html)
* ["Profiling"](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Profiling.html)
* ["Memory"](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/memory.html)

4.) **Optional** These chapters in "R for Data Science" are useful, but not mandatory for our work:

* ["Visualization"](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/visualize.html) - Good way to learn about ggplot2!
* ["Tidy data"](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy.html) - While all data at Avant is already tidy, it's good to understand the "tidy data" philosophy.
* ["More Lists"](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/lists.html) - Although lists are covered above it is such a fundamental datasctucture within R some more knowledge cant hurt.
