## Fairness

Go through the slides on [Machine Learning and Fairness](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11vNi2CxPMV_wFhfhpXBK8qe1o4KN59hNVaPeD4zagNA/edit).

1. Why is machine learning prone to unfairness (e.g., racism, sexism)?

2. How do we define fairness from a mathematical perspective?

3. How can we ensure machine learning algorthims provide fairness?

4. How is this relevant to Avant?

5. How might it matter to Avant beyond the (obviously important) social implications? (Think especially about how our customer base may be shifting over time.)
