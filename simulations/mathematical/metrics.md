How do you know if one GBM is better than another?

One metric we can use is AUC, which you can [read about here](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/132777/what-does-auc-stand-for-and-what-is-it).

Another metric is Gini, which you can [read about here](https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/Gini).

You should also read [this article](https://staesthetic.wordpress.com/2014/04/14/gini-roc-auc-and-accuracy/) about both AUC (review) and Gini.

1. What does AUC stand for?

2. What is a confusion matrix?

3. What is TPR and FPR? How are they relevant to AUC?

4. How do you compare models based on AUC? What about AUC indicates one model is better than another?

5. How do you compare models based on Gini? What about Gini indicates one model is better tahn another?

6. How is Gini similar and different from AUC?

7. Why would you use Gini instead of AUC? Why would you use AUC instead of Gini?
